PsyscaleDB is a lightweight Python library designed for efficient storage, querying, and management of financial timeseries data using a TimescaleDB-accelerated PostgreSQL backend. Built on top of psycopg and tightly integrated with pandas, it offers a simplified interface for working with financial timeseries datasets in the form of DataFrames. 

Designed for flexibility, the library leaves the backend database open for direct manipulation via psycopg commands whenever desired.
